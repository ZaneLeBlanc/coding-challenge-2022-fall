# I've been very frustrated with how expensive gas is in general, so I sought out to find which makes of cars have the best and worst MPG

# Process
I have yet to learn Kaggle, working with data in Python, and datasets. So after fooling around trying to learn some basics I opted to use MS Excel to work with the data. 

I started by removing identical cars (year, make, and model) narrowing the data from 8507 entries to 2469

I then sorted the data first by MaxMPG, and then when those have duplicates it sorted by MinMPG.

I finally filtered out any performance, value, and reliability that were below 4.5

# Results
High-end electric cars dominated the top of the list, followed by many hybrid cars as well. 
Gas efficiency was highest witht he Honda Civic EX-L, and followed by the civic LX and EX models. 
42MPG is about the maximum a gas only car can do.

Some notable Cars with great efficiency include:
2020 Mitsubishik Mirage G4 LE
2021 Toyota Corolla Hatchback SE
2021 Kit Forte FE
2014 Mazda Mazda3 iSV
2017 Chevrolet Cruze LS
